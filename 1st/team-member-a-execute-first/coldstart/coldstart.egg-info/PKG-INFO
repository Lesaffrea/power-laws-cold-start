        forecasting the global energy consumption of a building
        
        https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/55/schneider-cold-start/
        
        ## Code structure
        
             |_ source
             |_ notebooks: jupyter notebooks made during the challenge. They start by number for easier sorting.
             |_ reports: documents made during the challenge according to CRISP-DM methodology
             |_ tests: folder with tests for the library
             |_ data: folder with light data from teh challenge
             |_ rules: the official rules of the challenge
        
        ## Final solution
        You can find a script to recreate the final solution on scripts/final_solution folder
        
        ## Challenge workflow
        
        ### Start of the challenge
        1. Add dates to the calendar
        1. Download rules of the challenge
        2. Create a repository for the code using cookiecutter
        3. Create a Google keep label for tasks and ideas of the challenge
        3. Download the challenge data
        4. Create a conda environment for the challenge
        
            conda create -n repo_name pytest rope pylint tqdm numpy pandas sklearn
            source activate repo_name
            conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
        
        4. Work on the challenge
        5. Use TDD methodology whenever possible, this will save time because errors
        won't be propagated along the challenge.
        5. Have an aprentice aptitude, collaborate on the forum, I have a lot to learn
        from Kaggle.
        5. Prepare a report with a summary of the aproach to the challenge
        
        ### End of the challenge
        1. Prepare a report with a summary of the aproach to the challenge
        6. Download the Google keep tasks to the repository in pdf format
        6. Delete the tasks on google keep and the label
        7. Delete unnecessary data
        8. Update the environment yml
        
        ## Methodology
        I'm following CRISP-DM 1.0 methodology for the reports.

        I have skipped Evaluation and Deployment steps because they are not usually done on Kaggle.
